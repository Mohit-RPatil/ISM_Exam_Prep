# Industry Management Standards in Enterprise Storage

In a modern enterprise, storage systems are often composed of hardware and software from multiple vendors. To manage and monitor these heterogeneous environments, industry standards are essential. The most important standards for storage management are SNMP, CIM, and SMI-S.

## SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

SNMP is a widely used protocol for managing and monitoring network devices. It allows a central management station to query devices for information and to send commands to configure them.

*   **Role in Storage Management:** SNMP is used to monitor the health and performance of storage devices, such as storage arrays, switches, and servers. It can be used to collect information about:
    *   **Device status:** Whether the device is online or offline.
    *   **Performance metrics:** Such as I/O operations per second (IOPS), throughput, and latency.
    *   **Capacity utilization:** How much storage space is being used.
    *   **Errors and alerts:** Such as disk failures or high temperatures.

## CIM (Common Information Model)

CIM is a standard from the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) that provides a common way of describing and accessing management information in a network.

*   **Role in Storage Management:** CIM provides a common data model for describing storage devices and their components. This allows management applications to communicate with devices from different vendors in a consistent way.

## SMI-S (Storage Management Initiative Specification)

SMI-S is a standard from the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) that is based on CIM. It defines a set of profiles for managing storage devices, such as storage arrays, switches, and hosts.

*   **Role in Storage Management:** SMI-S is the most important standard for managing enterprise storage systems. It provides a standardized way to:
    *   **Discover storage devices:** Find all of the storage devices on the network.
    *   **Provision storage:** Create and allocate storage volumes to servers.
    *   **Monitor storage:** Monitor the health and performance of storage devices.
    *   **Manage security:** Configure security settings, such as zoning and LUN masking.

## How They Work Together

SNMP, CIM, and SMI-S work together to provide a comprehensive solution for managing enterprise storage systems.

1.  **CIM** provides the common data model.
2.  **SMI-S** extends CIM with specific profiles for storage devices.
3.  **SNMP** can be used to transport the CIM/SMI-S data between the management station and the storage devices.

# RAID Levels Explained

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.

## Standard RAID Levels

Here are the most common RAID levels:

### RAID 0: Striping

*   **Description:** Data is split into blocks and written across all the drives in the array.
*   **Minimum Disks:** 2
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Performance:** Read and write speeds are significantly increased because data is read from and written to multiple disks simultaneously.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **No Redundancy:** If any single drive fails, all data in the array is lost.
*   **Use Case:** Ideal for non-critical data that requires high-speed access, such as video editing or image processing.

### RAID 1: Mirroring

*   **Description:** Data is written to two drives simultaneously. One drive is a mirror of the other.
*   **Minimum Disks:** 2
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Redundancy:** If one drive fails, the other drive continues to operate, and the data is not lost.
    *   **Fast Read Speeds:** Read speeds can be improved by reading from both drives simultaneously.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **High Cost:** The effective storage capacity is only half of the total drive capacity.
*   **Use Case:** Suitable for critical data that requires high availability, such as operating system drives and database applications.

### RAID 2: Bit-level striping with dedicated parity

*   **Description:** Data is striped at the bit level across multiple drives, and error-correcting codes (ECC) are stored on separate, dedicated drives.
*   **Minimum Disks:** 3
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High data transfer rates:** Both for reads and writes.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **High Cost:** Requires a large number of drives.
    *   **Obsolete:** RAID 2 is no longer used in practice.

### RAID 3: Byte-level striping with dedicated parity

*   **Description:** Data is striped at the byte level across multiple drives, and parity information is stored on a single, dedicated drive.
*   **Minimum Disks:** 3
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High Read/Write Speeds:** Good for large sequential data transfers.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Parity Drive Bottleneck:** The dedicated parity drive can become a bottleneck for write operations.
*   **Use Case:** Suitable for applications that involve large sequential data, such as video streaming.

### RAID 4: Block-level striping with dedicated parity

*   **Description:** Similar to RAID 3, but data is striped at the block level.
*   **Minimum Disks:** 3
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Good Read Performance:** Read performance is good because data can be read from any of the data drives.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Parity Drive Bottleneck:** The dedicated parity drive can become a bottleneck for write operations.
*   **Use Case:** Similar to RAID 3, but more flexible for smaller data transfers.

### RAID 5: Block-level striping with distributed parity

*   **Description:** Data and parity information are striped across all the drives in the array.
*   **Minimum Disks:** 3
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Good Balance:** Offers a good balance of performance, storage capacity, and redundancy.
    *   **Good Read Performance:** Read performance is excellent.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Slower Write Performance:** Write performance is slower than RAID 0 or RAID 1 because of the need to calculate and write parity.
*   **Use Case:** One of the most common RAID levels, suitable for file servers, web servers, and general-purpose storage.

## Comparison of RAID Levels

| RAID Level | Minimum Disks | Storage Efficiency | Data Redundancy | Read Performance | Write Performance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RAID 0** | 2 | 100% | None | High | High |
| **RAID 1** | 2 | 50% | High | High | Normal |
| **RAID 2** | 3 | Varies | High | High | High |
| **RAID 3** | 3 | (n-1)/n | Good | High | Medium |
| **RAID 4** | 3 | (n-1)/n | Good | High | Low |
| **RAID 5** | 3 | (n-1)/n | Good | High | Medium |

# Connectivity Standards in Networked Storage

In networked storage, connectivity standards are the protocols and technologies that are used to connect servers to storage devices. The most common connectivity standards are SCSI, iSCSI, and Fibre Channel.

## SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)

SCSI is a set of standards for connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. It is a block-level protocol, which means that it transfers data in blocks, rather than as individual files.

*   **How it's used:** SCSI is not a networking protocol itself, but it is the underlying command set that is used by both iSCSI and Fibre Channel to communicate with storage devices.

## iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface)

iSCSI is a storage networking standard that allows SCSI commands to be sent over a standard TCP/IP network.

*   **How it's used:** iSCSI is used to create a Storage Area Network (SAN) using standard Ethernet hardware. This makes it a cost-effective alternative to Fibre Channel.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Cost-effective:** Uses standard Ethernet hardware, which is less expensive than Fibre Channel hardware.
    *   **Easy to manage:** Uses standard TCP/IP networking, which is familiar to most network administrators.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Performance:** Can be slower than Fibre Channel, especially on congested networks.

## Fibre Channel (FC)

Fibre Channel is a high-speed networking technology that is specifically designed for storage networking.

*   **How it's used:** Fibre Channel is used to create a high-performance SAN. It uses its own dedicated hardware, including Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) and Fibre Channel switches.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **High performance:** Provides very high-speed, low-latency connectivity.
    *   **Reliable:** It is a very reliable and robust protocol.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Expensive:** Requires specialized, expensive hardware.
    *   **Complex to manage:** Requires specialized knowledge to manage.

## Comparison: iSCSI vs. Fibre Channel

| Feature | iSCSI | Fibre Channel |
|---|---|---|
| **Transport Protocol** | TCP/IP (Ethernet) | Fibre Channel Protocol |
| **Hardware** | Standard Ethernet NICs and switches | Specialized HBAs and Fibre Channel switches |
| **Performance** | Good to excellent | Excellent |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Management** | Simpler | More complex |
